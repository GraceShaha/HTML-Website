About The Project: 
  This is a simple HTML-only project I created as my very first step into web development. 
  It helped me get comfortable with HTML tags, page structure, and creating multi-page websites using links.
  Although simple, this project marks the beginning of my web development journey. Itâ€™s here to show my growth 
  over time and to remind myself (and others) that everyone once started as a beginner.
